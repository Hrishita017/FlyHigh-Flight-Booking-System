# FlyHigh-Flight-Booking-System
Our flight booking system offers a streamlined platform for booking domestic flights within India. It provides a quick and efficient way to search for flights, book tickets, and manage travel plans, ensuring a user-friendly experience with robust backend functionality.

The frontend of the system leverages **React.js** and **Bootstrap**. React.js, with its component-based architecture, enables the creation of reusable UI components and ensures dynamic updates, enhancing user interaction. Bootstrap is used to ensure a responsive, visually appealing interface that adapts to different devices.

Key components include:

- **Homepage:** Acts as the entry point, showcasing the system's features, including a flight search form and company information. It combines React.js and Bootstrap to create an intuitive layout.

- **Search Flight:** Allows users to find flights based on preferences like departure city, destination, and date. React.js manages form states and user inputs, while Bootstrap ensures responsive design.

- **Add-Ons:** Provides options for additional services like refreshments and luggage facilities. React.js handles state management, and Bootstrap maintains consistent styling.

- **Payment Options:** Facilitates secure payments through various methods, including credit/debit cards and net banking. React.js manages payment logic, and Bootstrap ensures a user-friendly interface.

- **E-Ticket:** Generates electronic tickets upon successful booking, displaying booking details, passenger information, and a boarding barcode. React.js dynamically renders the ticket, with Bootstrap providing a clean layout.

The **backend** uses **MySQL** for robust data management and **Express.js** for building RESTful APIs, ensuring efficient communication between the frontend and database. Additional tools like **React Router**, **React-Bootstrap**, and **React-icons** enhance navigation, UI consistency, and icon usage.
